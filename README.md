**Project Description:**

I picked to create an NBA Stat Tracker project because I have a passion for the sport of basketball
and thought it would be fun to create a cool basketball website. The inspiration behind choosing this topic stems
from a genuine enthusiasm for the game and a desire to understand the different statistics that shape a player and the
team they are on. By developing a comprehensive stat tracker, I aim to deepen my skills in data visualization, coding,
and project management. This project allows me to have a unique opportunity to merge my technical expertise with a
personal interest, doing, so I can experience the complexities of real-time data collection, analysis, and
the creation of a full-on Spring Web Application within the context of professional basketball.
